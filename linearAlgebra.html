                    Linear algebra is one of the important branches of mathematics. 
                    Linear algebra is basically the study of vectors and linear functions. 
                    It is a key concept for almost all areas of mathematics. 
                    Linear algebra is considered a basic concept in the modern presentation of geometry. 
                    It is mostly used in Physics and Engineering as it helps to define the basic objects such as planes, 
                    lines, and rotations of the object. It allows us to model many natural phenomena, and also it has computing efficiency. <br><br>
                    In this article, you are going to learn about the basic introduction, 
                    its components, problems, linear equations, and its applications.

                        Linear algebra is the study of linear combinations. It is the study of vector 
                        spaces, lines, planes, and some mappings that are required to perform 
                        linear transformations. It includes vectors, matrices, and linear 
                        functions. It is the study of linear sets of equations and their transformation 
                        properties.

                <h3>Vector Spaces</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
                <p>
                    As we know that linear algebra deals with the study of vector spaces and
                    the linear transformations between them. By the definition of a vector, it is a
                    physical quantity that has both magnitude and direction. A vector space is
                    defined as the collection of objects called vectors, which may be added
                    together and multiplied (i.e. scaled) by numbers, called scalars. Generally,
                    <strong>real numbers</strong> are taken as scalars, but there exist vector spaces with scalar
                    multiplication by non-real numbers, i.e., complex numbers, or naturally any
                    field.<br><br>
            
                    The operations such as vector addition and scalar multiplication must
                    satisfy specific requirements, called vector axioms. Generally, the terms
                    real vector space and complex vector space are used to define that the
                    scalars are real or complex numbers, respectively.<br><br>
            
                    Suppose V be any vector space with elements a, b, c and scalars m, n over
                    a field F, then the vector axioms are given by:<br><br>
            
                    <strong>Commutative of addition:</strong> a + b = b + a<br>
                    <strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c<br>
                    <strong>Additive identity:</strong> a + 0 = 0 + a = a, where 0 is an element in V called
                    the zero vector.<br>
                    <strong>Additive inverse:</strong> a + (-a) = 0, where a and -a belong to V.
                </p>
            </div>

            <img src="./assets/img/la_img3.png" alt="Linear Algebra Intro Image" class="block-image">
            
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>
                    Other axioms include distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to
                    vector addition and field addition, identity element of scalar multiplication,
                    and so on.<br><br>
            
                    For example: <span class="equation">m(a) = ma</span>; <span class="equation">n(a + b) = na + nb</span><br><br>
            
                    An element of a specific vector space may have different characteristics.
                    For example, the elements can be a sequence, a function, a polynomial, or a
                    matrix. Linear algebra is affected by the properties of such elements that are
                    common or familiar to all vector spaces.<br><br>
            
                    A linear map can be written for two given vector spaces, namely V and W,
                    over a field F. This is sometimes referred to as a linear transformation or
                    mapping of vector spaces. Thus, it is given by:<br><br>
            
                    <span class="equation">T: V → W</span><br><br>
            
                    This allows us to write the addition and scalar multiplication of elements
                    such as:<br><br>
            
                    <span class="equation">T(a + b) = T(a) + T(b)</span><br>
                    <span class="equation">T(ma) = mT(a)</span>

                            A linear function is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a 
                            constant or the product of a constant and a single independent variable of 
                            power 1. In linear algebra, vectors are used when forming linear functions. 
                            Some examples of vectors can be rephrased in terms of the function of vectors.<br><br>
            
                            Mathematically, a linear function is defined as:<br><br>
            
                            A function L : R<sup>n</sup> → R<sup>m</sup> is linear if:<br><br>
            
                            (i) L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y)<br>
                            (ii) L(αx) = αL(x)<br><br>

                    Matrices are linear functions of a certain kind. A matrix is the result of
                    organizing information related to certain linear functions. Matrices frequently
                    appear in linear algebra because they are central to understanding its core
                    concepts.<br><br>
            
                    Mathematically, this relation can be defined as follows:<br><br>
            
                    A is an m × n matrix, then we get a linear function L : R<sup>n</sup> → R<sup>m</sup> by defining:<br><br>
                    <span class="equation">L(x) = Ax</span><br>
                    or<br>
                    <span class="equation">Ax = B</span><br><br>
            
                    Go through the example below to understand this mapping in detail.<br><br>
            
                    <strong>Question:</strong><br>
                    A room contains x bags and y boxes of fruits. Each bag contains 2 apples
                    and 4 bananas, and each box contains 6 apples and 8 bananas. There are a
                    total of 20 apples and 28 bananas in the room. Find the value of x and y.<br><br>
            
                    <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                    Write the simultaneous equations for the given information that satisfies the
                    conditions:<br><br>
            
                    <span class="equation">2x + 6y = 20</span><br>
                    <span class="equation">4x + 8y = 28</span><br><br>

                    Numerical linear algebra is also known as the applied linear algebra. Applied 
                    linear algebra deals with the study of how matrix operations can be used to 
                    create computer algorithms, which helps to solve the problems in 
                    continuous mathematics with efficiency and accuracy. In numerical linear 
                    algebra, many matrix decomposition methods are used to find the solutions 
                    for common linear algebraic problems like least-square optimization, 
                    locating Eigenvalues, and solving systems of linear equations. Some of the 
                    matrix decomposition methods in numerical linear algebra include Eigen 
                    decomposition, Single value decomposition, QR factorization and so on.

                <h3>Linear Algebra Applications</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
                <div class="first-paragraph">
                    <p>Here, some of the linear algebra applications are given as:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ranking in Search Engines:</strong> One of the most important applications of 
                            linear algebra is in the creation of Google. The most complicated ranking 
                            algorithm is created with the help of linear algebra.
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li><strong>Signal Analysis:</strong> It is massively used in encoding, analyzing, and 
                            manipulating signals that can be either audio, video, or images, etc.
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li><strong>Linear Programming:</strong> Optimization is an important application of linear 
                            algebra, which is widely used in the field of linear programming.
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li><strong>Error-Correcting Codes:</strong> It is used in coding theory. If encoded data is 
                            tampered with slightly, linear algebra can help recover it. One such important 
                            error-correcting code is called Hamming code.
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Predictions of some objects can be made using linear models, 
                            which are developed using linear algebra.
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> An automated facial recognition technology that uses 
                            linear algebraic expressions is called principal component analysis.
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> An important part of graphics is projecting a 3-dimensional 
                            scene onto a 2-dimensional screen, which is handled only by linear maps explained 
                            by linear algebra.
