            <p>An exponential function is a mathematical function, which is used in many real-world 
                situations. It is mainly used to find the exponential decay or exponential growth or 
                to compute investments, model populations and so on. In this article, you will learn 
                about exponential function formulas, rules, properties, graphs, derivatives, exponential series and examples

        <h3>What is Exponential Function?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <p>Exponential function, as its name suggests, involves exponents. But note that, an exponential
             function has a constant as its base and a variable as its exponent but not the other way round
              (if a function has a variable as the base and a constant as the exponent then it is a power 
              function but not an exponential function). An exponential function can be in one of the following forms.
        </p>

    <div class="text-block">
        <p>
            In mathematics, an exponential function is a function of form f (x) = ax, where “x” is a variable
             and “a” is a constant which is called the base of the function and it should be greater than 0.

    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <div class="first-paragraph">
        <p>Here are some examples of exponential function.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    f(x) = 2^x
                </li>
                <li>
                    f(x) = (1/2)^x

                    f(x) = 4 (3)^-0.5x

    <div class="sectionsubheading">
        <p style="text-align: center;">Exponential Function Formula:</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <p>An exponential function is defined by the formula f(x) = ax, where the input variable x 
            occurs as an exponent. The exponential curve depends on the exponential function and it depends on the value of the x.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The exponential function is an important mathematical function which is of the form.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong>f(x) = ax</strong></p><br>
        <p>
            Where a>0 and a is not equal to 1.<br><br>

x is any real number.<br><br>
 
If the variable is negative, the function is undefined for -1 < x < 1.<br><br>

Here,<br>

“x” is a variable<br>

“a” is a constant, which is the base of the function.<br>

An exponential curve grows, or decay depends on the exponential function. Any quantity that 
grows or decays by a fixed per cent at regular intervals should possess either exponential growth or exponential decay.

        </p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Exponential Growth</strong>
        </p><br>
        <p>
            In Exponential Growth, the quantity increases very slowly at first, and then rapidly. 
            The rate of change increases over time. The rate of growth becomes faster as time passes. 
            The rapid growth is meant to be an “exponential increase”. The formula to define the exponential growth is:<br><br>

                                         <strong>y = a ( 1+ r )x</strong><br>
Where r is the growth percentage.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Exponential Decay</strong>
        </p><br>
        <p>In Exponential Decay, the quantity decreases very rapidly at first, and then slowly. The rate 
            of change decreases over time. The rate of change becomes slower as time passes. The rapid 
            growth meant to be an “exponential decrease”. The formula to define the exponential growth is:</p><br>
            <p>
                <strong>y = a ( 1- r )x</strong><br>
                Where r is the decay percentage.
            </p><br>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionsubheading">
        <p style="text-align: center;">Exponential Function Graph:</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <div class="first-paragraph">
        <p>The following figure represents the graph of exponents of x. It can be seen that as 
            the exponent increases, the curves get steeper and the rate of growth increases respectively. 
            Thus, for x > 1, the value of y = fn(x) increases for increasing values of (n).
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/paint5 1.png" alt="ef" >
            <p>
                From the above, it can be seen that the nature of polynomial functions is dependent on their degree.
                 The higher the degree of any polynomial function, the higher its growth. A function which grows 
                 faster than a polynomial function is y = f(x) = ax, where a>1. Thus, for any of the positive integers
                  n the function f (x) is said to grow faster than that of fn(x).
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Thus, the exponential function having base greater than 1, i.e., a > 1 is defined as y = f(x) = ax. 
                The domain of exponential function will be the set of entire real numbers R and the range are said 
                to be the set of all the positive real numbers.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                It must be noted that the exponential function is increasing and the point (0, 1) always lies on the 
                graph of an exponential function. Also, it is very close to zero if the value of x is mostly negative.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Exponential function having base 10 is known as a common exponential function. Consider the following series:
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/Exponential Function Graph 1.png" alt="ef" >
            <p>
                The value of this series lies between 2 & 3. It is represented by e. Keeping e as the base of the function, 
                we get y = ex, which is a very important function in mathematics known as a natural exponential function.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                For a > 1, the logarithm of b to base a is x if ax = b. Thus, loga b = x if ax = b.
                 This function is known as logarithmic function.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/3 61.png" alt="ef" >
            <p>
                For base a = 10, this function is known as a common logarithm and for the base a = e, it is known as a natural 
                logarithm denoted by ln x. Following are some of the important observations regarding 
                logarithmic functions which have a base a>1.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The domain of log function consists of positive real numbers only, as we cannot 
                        interpret the meaning of log functions for negative values.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        For the log function, though the domain is only the set of positive real numbers, the 
                        range is a set of all real values, i.e. R
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        When we plot the graph of log functions and move from left to right, the functions show increasing behaviour.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The graph of log function never cuts the x-axis or y-axis, though it seems to tend toward them.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <strong>Exponential Function Rules</strong><br><br>
            Some important exponential rules are given below:<br><br>
            If a>0, and  b>0, the following hold true for all the real numbers x and y:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>ax ay = ax+y</li>
                <li>ax/ay = ax-y</li>
                <li>(ax)y = axy</li>
                <li>axbx=(ab)x</li>
                <li>(a/b)x= ax/bx</li>
                <li>a0=1</li>
                <li>a-x= 1/ ax</li>
            </ul>
        </p><br>
         <p>
            <strong>Exponential Functions Examples</strong><br><br>
            The examples of exponential functions are:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>f(x) = 2x</li>
                <li>f(x) = 1/ 2x = 2-x</li>
                <li>f(x) = 2x+3</li>
                <li>f(x) = 0.5x</li>
