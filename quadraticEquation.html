        <h3>ALGEBRA : Quadratic Equation</h3>
    </div>

    <img src="assets/img/Logo.png" alt="Blog Banner" class="banner-image">
    
    <div class="text-block">
            <p>Quadratic equations are second-degree algebraic expressions and are of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
                 The term "quadratic" comes from the Latin word "quadratus" meaning square, which refers to the 
                 fact that the variable x is squared in the equation. In other words, a quadratic equation is an 
                 “equation of degree 2.” There are many scenarios where a quadratic equation is used. Did you know 
                 that when a rocket is launched, its path is described by a quadratic equation? Further, a quadratic
                  equation has numerous applications in physics, engineering, astronomy, etc.
                Quadratic equations have maximum of two solutions, which can be real or complex numbers.
                 These two solutions (values of x) are also called the roots of the quadratic equations and are
                  designated as (α, β). We shall learn more about the roots of a quadratic equation in the below content.
            </p>
            
    </div>

    <div class="subtitle-section">
        <h3>What is Quadratic Equation?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <p>A quadratic equation is an algebraic equation of the second degree in x. The quadratic equation in its 
            standard form is ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a and b are the coefficients, x is the variable, and c is the
             constant term. The important condition for an equation to be a quadratic equation is the coefficient of 
             x2 is a non-zero term (a ≠ 0). For writing a quadratic equation in standard form, the x2 term is written 
             first, followed by the x term, and finally, the constant term is written.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/paint2 1.png" alt="quadratic" >
        <p>
            Further, in real math problems the quadratic equations are presented in different forms:
             (x - 1)(x + 2) = 0, -x2 = -3x + 1, 5x(x + 3) = 12x, x3 = x(x2 + x - 3). All of these equations 
             need to be transformed into standard form of the quadratic equation before performing further operations.
        </p>

    <div class="sectionsubheading">
        <p style="text-align: center;">Quadratics Formula:</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <p>The formula for a quadratic equation is used to find the roots of the equation. Since quadratics have a 
            degree equal to two, therefore there will be two solutions for the equation. Suppose ax² + bx + c = 0 is
             the quadratic equation, then the formula to find the roots of this equation will be:
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/paint3 1.png" alt="quadratic2" >
        <p>
            The sign of plus/minus indicates there will be two solutions for x. Learn in detail the quadratic formula here.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            This formula is also known as the Sridharacharya formula.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Example: </strong>Let us find the roots of the same equation that was mentioned in the earlier
             section x2 - 3x - 4 = 0 using the quadratic formula.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            a = 1, b = -3, and c = -4.
x = [-b ± √(b2 - 4ac)]/2a <br>= [-(-3) ± √((-3)2 - 4(1)(-4))]/2(1) <br>= [3 ± √25] / 2 = [3 ± 5] / 2 <br>= (3 + 5)/2 or (3 - 5)/2 <br>= 8/2 or -2/2<br>= 4 or -1 are the roots.

    <div class="sectionsubheading">
        <p style="text-align: center;">How to Solve Quadratic Equations?</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <div class="first-paragraph">
        <p>There are basically four methods of solving quadratic equations. They are:<br><br>

            -Factoring<br><br>
            
            -Completing the square<br><br>
            
            -Using Quadratic Formula<br><br>
            
            -Taking the square root
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Factoring of Quadratics:</strong><br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Begin with a equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Ensure that it is set to adequate zero.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Factor the left-hand side of the equation by assuming zero on the right-hand side of the equation.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Assign each factor equal to zero.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Now solve the equation in order to determine the values of x.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Suppose if the main coefficient is not equal to one then deliberately, you have to follow a 
            methodology in the arrangement of the factors.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>

<strong>Example:</strong><br><br>

2x²-x-6=0<br>
(2x+3)(x-2)=0<br>
2x+3=0<br>
x=-3/2<br>
x=2
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Completing the Square Method:</strong><br><br>
            Let us learn this method with example.

<strong>Example:</strong> Solve 2x2 – x – 1 = 0.<br><br>

First, move the constant term to the other side of the equation.<br>
2x2 – x = 1<br>
Dividing both sides by 2.<br>
x2 – x/2 = ½<br>
Add the square of half of the coefficient of x, (b/2a)2, on both the sides, i.e., 1/16<br>
x2 – x/2 + 1/16 = ½ + 1/16<br>
Now we can factor the right side,<br>
(x-¼)2 = 9/16 = (¾)2<br>
Taking root on both sides;<br>
X – ¼ = ±3/4<br>
Add ¼ on both sides<br>
X = ¼ ± ¾<br><br>

Therefore,<br>
X = ¼ + ¾ = 4/4 = 1<br>
X = ¼ – ¾ = -2/4 = -½ <br>
        </p><br>

        <p>
            <strong>Taking the Square Root:</strong><br><br>

We can use this method for the equations such as:<br>
x2 + a2 = 0<br><br>

<strong>Example:</strong> Solve x2 – 50 = 0.<br><br>
x2 – 50 = 0<br>
x2 = 50<br>
Taking the roots both sides<br>
√x2 = ±√50<br>
x = ±√(2 x 5 x 5)<br>
x = ±5√2<br><br>

Thus, we got the required solution.
        </p>
