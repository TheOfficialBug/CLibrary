        <h6>Angles: An Introduction</h6>
    </div>
    <img src="assets/img/Logo.png" alt="Linear Algebra Banner" class="banner-image">

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="text-block">
        <p>
            An angle is formed when two rays are joined together at a common point.
            The common point here is called node or vertex and the two rays are called 
            arms of the angle. The angle is represented by the symbol ‘∠’. The 
            word angle came from the Latin word “Angulus”. Learn more about lines 
            and angles here.

            The angle is usually measured in degrees, using a protractor. Degrees 30°, 
            45°, 60°, 90°, 180° shows different angles here. The types of angles are 
            based on the values of angles in degrees. 

            We can also represent angles in radians, i.e., in terms of pi (π). 180 
            degrees is equal to π in radians. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: What are Adjacent Angles? -->
    <div class="subtitle-section">
        <h3>Definition Of Angles</h3>
    </div>
       <p>
        An <strong>angle</strong> is a form of geometrical shape, that is constructed by joining 
        two rays to each other at their end-points. The angle can also be 
        represented by three letters of the shape that define the angle, with the 
        middle letter being where the angle actually is (i.e.its vertex). Angles are 
        generally represented by Greek letters such as θ, α, β, etc.

       </p>

        <p>
            Eg. ∠ABC, where B is the given angle.

            Angle measurement terms are – degree °, radians or gradians.

            The amount of rotation about the point of intersection of two planes 
            (or lines) which is required to bring one in correspondence with the other is 
            called an Angle.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Types of Angles and Their Properties</h2>
        <p>
            There are six types of angles. Each type of angle has a unique 
            identification on the basis of angle measurement.Let us read about each 
            type of angle individually along with their properties.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Acute Angle:</h3>
            <p>An acute angle is an angle that is greater than 0° and less than 90°.</p>
            <h3>Right Angle:</h3>
            <p>When an angle measures 90°, it is known as a right angle. A right angle can be easily observed as it forms the shape of the letter L.</p>
            <h3>Obtuse Angle:</h3>
            <p>An angle that measures greater than 90° but less than 180°, it is an obtuse angle.</p>
            <h3>Straight Angle:</h3>
            <p>
                The angle formed by a straight line is called a straight angle. In other
                words, a straight angle is a straight line, and the angle formed between 
                two rays is equal to 180°. At a straight angle, the two rays are opposite to 
                each other. Two right angles make up a straight angle. Since the measure 
                of a straight angle is 180°, it is one-half of the whole turn of a circle.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflex Angle:</h3>
            <p>A reflex angle is an angle whose measure is greater than 180° but less than 360°.</p>
            <h3>Complete Angle/Full Rotation:</h3>
            <p>When the measurement of an angle is equal to 360°, it is a complete angle.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="subtitle-section">
            <h3>Angle Based on Rotation</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Based on the direction of measurement or rotation, angles can be of two types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>• Positive Angles:</strong> Measured in the counterclockwise direction.</li>
            <li><strong>• Negative Angles:</strong> Measured in the clockwise direction.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Positive Angles</h2>
        <p>An angle measured in the counterclockwise (anti-clockwise) direction is a 
            positive angle. In other words, positive angles are those angles that are 
            rotated from the base in the anti-clockwise direction.</p><br>
        <h2>Negative Angles</h2>
        <p>Negative angles are those angles that are measured in a clockwise 
            direction from the base. In other words, negative angles are those angles 
            that are angles are rotated from the base in the clockwise direction.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/img/positive-angle-negative-angle 1.png" alt="Positive and Negative Angles">
        </div><br>
        <h2>Parts of Angles</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/img/Terminal side 1.png" alt="Positive and Negative Angles">
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>• Vertex:</strong>- The corner points of an angle is known as Vertex. It is the point where two rays meet.
            </li>
            <li><strong>• Arms:</strong>- The two sides of an angle joined at the common endpoint.</li>
            <li><strong>• Initial Side:</strong>- It is also known as the reference line. All the 
                measurements are done taking this line as the reference.</li>
            <li><strong>• Terminal Side:</strong>- It is the side (or ray) up to which the angle measurement is done.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="subtitle-section">
            <h3>Angle Based on Rotation</h3>
        </div>
        <p>To measure everything in this world, we need a unit in a similar angle 
            measurement requires three units of measurement :</p><br>
        <h2>Degree of an Angle</h2>
        <p>
            It is represented by ° (read as a degree). It most likely comes from 
            Babylonians, who used a base 60 (Sexagesimal) number system. In their 
            calendar, there was a total of 360 days. Hence, they adopted a full angle 
            to be 360°. First, they tried to divide a full angle into angles using the 
            angle of an equilateral triangle. Later, following their number system (base 
            60), they divided 60° by 60 and defined that as 1°. Sometimes, it is also 
            referred to as arc degree or arc-degree which means the degree of an arc. <br>

            An angle is said to be equal to 1° if the rotation from the initial to the 
            terminal side is equal to 1/360 of the full rotation. <br>
            
            A degree is further divided into minutes and seconds. 1′ (1 minute) is 
            defined as one-sixtieth of a degree and 1” (1 second) is defined as one-
            sixtieth of a minute. Thus,<br>
            
            1°= 60′ = 3600”
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="assets/img/angles-in-degrees (1) 1.png" alt="Degree Measurement">
        </div>
        <h2>Radian of an Angle</h2>
        <p>
            This is the SI unit of angle. Radian is mostly used in Calculus. All the 
            formula for derivatives and integrals hold true only when angles are 
            measured in terms of a radian. It is denoted by ‘rad’. <br>

            The length of the arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the 
            measurement in radian of the angle that it subtends. <br>

            In a complete circle, there are 2π radians. <br>

            360 = 2π; radian <br>

            Therefore, 1 radian = 180°/π
        </p>
        <h2>Gradian of an Angle:</h2>
        <p>
            This unit is least used in Maths. It is also called a gon or a grade. <br>

            An angle is equal to 1 gradian if the rotation from the initial to terminal 
            side is 1/400 of the full rotation. Hence, the full angle is equal to 400 
            gradians. <br>
            
            It is denoted by ‘grad’.
        </p>

            CANCELLATION POLICY:
            <br><br>
            1. Class Cancellations by Students:<br>
               - Students can cancel or reschedule a maximum of 6 sessions per 48 sessions.<br>
               - Cancellations or rescheduling must be done at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled class time.<br>
               - Failure to cancel or reschedule within this timeframe will result in the session being marked as a "No Show."
               <br><br>
            2. No Show Policy:<br>
               - If a student does not join a class without prior cancellation, it will be treated as a "Student No Show."<br>
               - "No Show" sessions will be marked as completed and will not be eligible for rescheduling or compensation.
               <br><br>
            3. Instructor Cancellations:<br>
               - In the event of a class cancellation by the instructor, the session will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient time without any penalty to the student.<br>
               - If rescheduling is not possible, the session will be converted into credits which can be used for future classes.
               <br><br>
            4. Extenuating Circumstances:<br>
               - In case of medical emergencies or other extenuating circumstances, students can appeal for exceptions to the cancellation policy.<br>
               - Such appeals must be supported by relevant documentation and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
