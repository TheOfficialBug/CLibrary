    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="text-block">
        <p>
            An angle is formed when two rays are joined together at a common point.
            The common point here is called node or vertex and the two rays are called 
            arms of the angle. The angle is represented by the symbol ‘∠’. The 
            word angle came from the Latin word “Angulus”. Learn more about lines 
            and angles here.

            The angle is usually measured in degrees, using a protractor. Degrees 30°, 
            45°, 60°, 90°, 180° shows different angles here. The types of angles are 
            based on the values of angles in degrees. 

            We can also represent angles in radians, i.e., in terms of pi (π). 180 
            degrees is equal to π in radians.

        <h3>Definition Of Angles</h3>
    </div>
     <div class="text-block">
                <p>
                    An <strong>angle</strong> is a form of geometrical shape, that is constructed by joining 
                    two rays to each other at their end-points. The angle can also be 
                    represented by three letters of the shape that define the angle, with the 
                    middle letter being where the angle actually is (i.e.its vertex). Angles are 
                    generally represented by Greek letters such as θ, α, β, etc.

                <p>
                    Eg. ∠ABC, where B is the given angle.

                    Angle measurement terms are – degree °, radians or gradians.
                    
                    The amount of rotation about the point of intersection of two planes (or lines) 
                    which is required to bring one in correspondence with the other is called an Angle.

    <!-- Types of Angles -->

        <div class="subtitle-section">
            <h3>Types of Angles and Their Properties</h3>
        </div>
    <div class="text-block">
        <p>
            There are six types of angles. Each type of angle has a unique 
            identification on the basis of angle measurement. Let us read about each 
            type of angle individually along with their properties.
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acute Angle:</strong> An acute angle is an angle which is greater than 0° and less than 90°.</li>
                <li><strong>Right Angle:</strong> When an angle measures 90°, it is known as a right angle. A right angle 
                    can be easily observed as it forms the shape of the letter L.</li>
                <li><strong>Obtuse Angle:</strong>When an angle measures greater than 90° but less than 180°, it is an obtuse angle.</li>
                <li><strong>Straight Angle:</strong>Straight Angle:
                    The angle formed by a straight line is called a straight angle. In other 
                    words, a straight angle is a straight line, and the angle formed between 
                    two rays is equal to 180°. At a straight angle, the two rays are opposite to 
                    each other. Two right angles make up a straight angle. Since the measure 
                    of a straight angle is 180°, it is one-half of the whole turn of a circle.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflex Angle:</strong> A reflex angle is an angle whose measure is greater
                     than 180° but less than 360°.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Angle:</strong> When the measurement of an angle is equal to 360° it is a complete angle.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </div>

            <p>
                Based on the direction of measurement or the direction of rotation,
                angles can be of two types:
                
                • Positive Angles

            <p>To measure everything in this world, we need a unit in a similar angle 
                measurement requires three units of measurement :</p>

                <div style="text-align: center;" class="sectionsubheading">
                    <h3>Degree of an Angle:</h3>

                    <p>
                        It is represented by ° (read as a degree). It most likely comes from Babylonians, who used a base 60 (Sexagesimal) number system. In their calendar, there was a total of 360 days. Hence, they adopted a full angle to be 360°. First, they tried to divide a full angle into angles using the angle of an equilateral triangle. Later, following their number system (base 60), they divided 60° by 60 and defined that as 1°. Sometimes, it is also referred to as arc degree or arc-degree which means the degree of an arc. <br>
                        An angle is said to be equal to 1° if the rotation from the initial to the terminal side is equal to 1/360 of the full rotation.
                        
                        A degree is further divided into minutes and seconds. 1′ (1 minute) is defined as one-sixtieth of a degree and 1” (1 second) is defined as one-sixtieth of a minute. Thus,
                        
                        1°= 60′ = 3600”

                    <p>
                        This is the SI unit of angle. Radian is mostly used in Calculus. All the formula for derivatives and integrals hold true only when angles are measured in terms of a radian. It is denoted by ‘rad’.
                        The length of the arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radian of the angle that it subtends.
                        In a complete circle, there are 2π radians.
                        
                        360 = 2π; radian
                        
                        Therefore, 1 radian = 180°/π

                        This unit is least used in Maths. It is also called a gon or a grade.
                        An angle is equal to 1 gradian if the rotation from the initial to terminal side is 1/400 of the full rotation. Hence, the full angle is equal to 400 gradians.
                        It is denoted by ‘grad’.
