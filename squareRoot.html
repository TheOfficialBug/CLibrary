            The square root of a number is the inverse operation of squaring a number. 
            The square of a number is the value that is obtained when we multiply the number by itself,
             while the square root of a number is obtained by finding a number that when squared gives the original number.
            If 'a' is the square root of 'b', it means that a × a = b. 
            The square of any number is always a positive number, so every number has two square roots, one of a positive value, and one of a negative value. For example, both 2 and -2 are square roots of 4. However, in most places, only the positive value is written as the square root of a number.

            <p>
                The square root of a number is that factor of a number which when multiplied by itself 
                gives the original number. Squares and square roots are special exponents. 
                Consider the number 9. When 3 is multiplied by itself, it gives 9 as the product. 
                This can be written as 3 × 3 or 32. Here, the exponent is 2, and we call it a square. 
                Now when the exponent is 1/2, it refers to the square root of the number. 

                For example, √n = n1/2, where n is a positive integer.

                    The square root of a number is the value of power 1/2 of that number. 
                    In other words, it is the number whose product by itself gives the original number. 
                    It is represented using the symbol '√ '. The square root symbol is called a radical, 
                    whereas the number under the square root symbol is called the radicand.                     <br><br>

                     Let us say m is a positive integer, such that  √(m.m) = √(m2) = m<br><br>

                    In mathematics, a square root function is defined as a one-to-one<br>function 
                    that takes a positive number as an input and returns the<br>square root of the given input number.<br><br>

                    f(x) = √x <br><br>

                    For example, if x=4, then the function returns the output value as 2.<br>
                    Note: The square root of a negative number represents a complex<br>number.<br>
                    Suppose √-n = i√n, where i is the imaginary number.<br><br>

                <p>Here, some of the linear algebra applications are given as:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a number is a perfect square number, then there exists a perfect square root.

                    <li>If a number ends with an even number of zeros (0’s), then it can have a square root.

                    <li>The two square root values can be multiplied. For example, √3 can be multiplied by √2,

                    <li>When two same square roots are multiplied, then the result should be a radical number.
                         It means that the result is a non-square root number. 
                         For instance, when √7 is multiplied by √7, the result obtained is 7.

            <h3>How to Find Square Root?</h3>

                <div class="first-paragraph">
                    <p>To find the square root of a number, we just see by squaring which number would give the actual number.
                         It is very easy to find the square root of a number that is a perfect square. Perfect squares are 
                         those positive numbers that can be expressed as the product of a number by itself. In other words,
                          perfect squares are numbers which are expressed as the value of power 2 of any integer. We can use 
                          <strong>four methods to find the square root of numbers</strong> and those methods are as follows:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Repeated Subtraction Method
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li>Prime Factorization Method
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li>Estimation Method
                        </li><br>
            
                        <li>Long Division Method
                        </li><br>
            
                    </ul>
                    <p>It should be noted that the first three methods can be conveniently used for perfect squares, while the fourth 
                        method, i.e., the long division method can be used for any number whether it is a perfect square or not.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sectionsubheading">
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Repeated Subtraction Method of Square Root:</p>
                </div>
                        <p>This is a very simple method. We subtract the consecutive odd numbers from the number for which we are finding the 
                            square root, till we reach 0. The number of times we subtract is the square root of the given number. 
                            This method works only for perfect square numbers. Let us find the square root of 16 using this method.
                            <ol>
                            <li>16 - 1 = 15</li>
                                <li>15 - 3 = 12</li>
                                <li>12 - 5 = 7</li>
                                <li>7 - 7 = 0</li>
                            </ol>
                            You can observe that we have subtracted 4 times. Thus,√16 = 4<br><br>

                </div>
                        <p>Prime factorization of any number means to represent that number as a product of prime numbers.
                             To find the square root of a given number through the prime factorization method, we follow 
                             the steps given below:<br><br>
                             <ul>
                                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Divide the given number into its prime factors.
                                </li><br>

                </div>
                        <p>Estimation and approximation refer to a reasonable guess of the actual value to make 
                            calculations easier and more realistic. This method helps in estimating and approximating 
                            the square root of a given number. Let us use this method to find √15. Find the nearest 
                            perfect square number to 15. 9 and 16 are the perfect square numbers nearest to 15.   
                            We know that √16 = 4 and √9 = 3. This implies that √15 lies between 3 and 4. 
                            Now, we need to see if √15 is closer to 3 or 4. Let us consider 3.5 and 4. 
                            Since 3.52 = 12.25 and 42= 16. Thus, √15 lies between 3.5 and 4 and is closer to 4.<br><br>

                            Let us find the squares of 3.8 and 3.9. Since 3.82 = 14.44 and 3.92 = 15.21. 
                            This implies that √15 lies between 3.8 and 3.9. We can repeat the process and check 
                            between 3.85 and 3.9. We can observe that √15 = 3.872.
                            This is a very long process and time-consuming.

                        <p>Long division is a method for dividing large numbers into steps or parts, breaking the

                             any given number using this method. Let us understand the process of finding square root
                              by the long division method with an example. Let us find the square root of 180.<br><br>

                                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place a bar over every pair of digits of the number starting from the units'
                                     place (right-most side). We will have two pairs, i.e., 1 and 80
                                     
                                </li><br>

                                    <strong>Step 2:</strong> We divide the left-most number by the largest number whose square is less than or equal 
                                    to the number in the left-most pair.

                                    together with the result of the sum, forms a new divisor for the new dividend that is carried down.

                                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> The new number in the quotient will have the same number as selected in the divisor. The condition is 
                                    the same — as being either less than or equal to the dividend.

                </div><br><br>
                <p>The square root of a negative number cannot be a real number, since a square is either a 
                    positive number or zero. But complex numbers have the solutions to the square root of a 
                    negative number. The principal square root of -x is: √(-x)= i√x. Here, i is the square root of -1.
                    For example: Take a perfect square number like 16. Now, let's see the square root of -16.
                     There is no real square root of -16. √(-16)= √16 × √(-1) = 4i (as, √(-1)= i), where 'i' is 
                     represented as the square root of -1. So, 4i is a square root of -16.

                </div><br><br>
                <p>Any number raised to exponent two (y2) is called the square of the base. So, 52 or 25 is 
                    referred to as the square of 5, while 82 or 64 is referred to as the square of 8.
                     We can easily find the square of a number by multiplying the number two times. 
                     For example, 52 = 5 × 5 = 25, and 82 = 8 × 8 = 64. When we find the square of a 
                     whole number, the resultant number is a perfect square. Some of the perfect squares 
                     we have are 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and so on. The square of a number is always a positive number.

                </div><br><br>
                <p>The square of a number can be found by multiplying a number by itself. 
                    For single-digit numbers, we can use multiplication tables to find the square,
                     while in the case of two or more than two-digit numbers, we perform multiplication of the 
                     number by itself to get the answer. For example, 9 × 9 = 81, where 81 is the square of 9.
                      Similarly, 3 × 3 = 9, where 9 is the square of 3.

                    The square of a number is written by raising the exponent to 2. For example, 
                    the square of 3 is written as 32 and is read as "3 squared". <br><br>

                <p>There is very strong relation between squares and square roots as each one of them is the inverse
                     relation of the other. i.e., if x2 = y then x = √y.

                <p>
                    It can be simply remembered like this: <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        
                        <li>When "square" is removed from one side of the equation, we get the square root on 
                            the other side. For example, 42 = 16 means, 4 = √16. This is also known as "taking square root on both sides".
                        </li>
            
                        <li>When "square root" is removed from one side of the equation, we get square on the other side.
                             For example, √25 = 5 means, 25 = 52. This is also known as "squaring on both sides"
                        </li>
                </ul>
                This logic helps in solving many equations in algebra. Consider the following example:<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Solve the equation √(2x + 3) = 10.<br>
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Squaring on both sides of the equation would result in the cancellation of<br> the square root on the left side.
2x + 3 = 102<br>
2x + 3 = 100<br>
2x = 97<br>
x = 97/2 = 48.5<br>
